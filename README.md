# *Mark My Words*
A game for Open Jam 2017 by the Geeks and Gadgets Club
at Marshall University ([http://mugeeks.org/](http://mugeeks.org/)).

## Dependencies
*Mark My Words* was made for Python 2 and depends on the Pygame
library.

You can obtain Pygame by using the "pip" package manager
which normally comes with Python.  To do so, run the following
command:

    pip install --user pygame

If you have Python 3 installed, you may need to run the following
command instead to make sure you are installing Pygame for Python 2.

    pip2 install --user pygame

## Running
You can run the game with this command:

    python main.py

If you have Python 3, you may need to specify that you want to run
the game with Python 2.  To do that, use this command:

    python2 main.py
